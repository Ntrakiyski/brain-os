**Status**: Design Complete - Awaiting User Approval
**Date**: 2026-01-13

---

## Quick Overview

This document summarizes the 3-phase approach to integrating Obsidian with Brain OS.

| Phase | Goal | User Stories | Effort | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | Neo4j → Obsidian sync on memory creation | 8 stories | 13 hours | ⏳ Awaiting Approval |
| **Phase 2** | Bidirectional sync (cron every 15min) + bulk export | 8 stories | 22 hours | ⏳ Awaiting Approval |
| **Phase 3** | Voice memo processing with AI agents | 7 stories | 26 hours | ⏳ Awaiting Approval |

**Total Effort**: ~61 hours (5-8 days of focused development)

## Phase 1: Basic Neo4j → Obsidian Sync

**Goal**: When I create a memory → File appears in Obsidian

### Key Features
- ✅ Connect to YuNaga224/obsidian-memory-mcp server
- ✅ `create_memory` tool creates entity in Obsidian vault
- ✅ File has YAML frontmatter + markdown body
- ✅ Works with local Obsidian (free version)
- ✅ Graceful degradation if Obsidian offline

### User Stories
1. Setup Obsidian MCP Server Locally
2. Add Obsidian MCP Client to Brain OS
3. Create Entity Name Generator Utility
4. Enhance `create_memory` to Sync to Obsidian
5. Create Obsidian Entity File Structure
6. Add Environment Variable for Obsidian MCP URL
7. Test End-to-End Memory Creation
8. Handle Obsidian MCP Server Offline

### Success Criteria
- Create memory in Brain OS → Entity file appears in Obsidian
- Open Obsidian → See entity in graph view
- Search in Obsidian → Find entity by content
- Neo4j remains source of truth

**Timeline**: 1-2 days

- ✅ Detects changed files in Obsidian vault
- ✅ Updates Neo4j bubbles with Obsidian edits
- ✅ Conflict resolution (newest timestamp wins)
- ✅ Bulk export tool for existing memories
- ✅ Entity relationships in graph view
- ✅ Manual sync trigger

### User Stories
1. Parse Obsidian Entity Files
2. Detect Changed Files in Obsidian Vault
3. Update Neo4j Bubble from Obsidian Entity
4. Create Cron Job for Bidirectional Sync
5. Handle Sync Conflicts
6. Bulk Export Existing Memories to Obsidian
7. Create Entity Relationships in Obsidian
8. Add Manual Sync Trigger Tool

### Success Criteria
- Edit file in Obsidian → Neo4j updates in 15 minutes
- Bulk export 50+ memories → All appear in Obsidian
- Obsidian graph view shows entity relationships
- Conflicts resolved correctly (newest wins)

**Timeline**: 2-3 days

## Phase 3: Voice Memo Processing + Advanced Workflows

**Goal**: 15-minute voice memo → 3-5 memories created automatically

### Key Features
- ✅ Process pre-transcribed text (Claude handles transcription via MCP)
- ✅ AI entity extraction (Groq)
- ✅ Content segmentation by sector (Groq)
- ✅ Observation generation (OpenRouter)
- ✅ Multi-memory creation in Neo4j + Obsidian
- ✅ Daily note updates
- ✅ Weekly review with Obsidian insights

### User Stories
1. Extract Entities from Transcript
2. Segment Transcript into Multiple Memories
3. Generate Observations for Each Segment
4. Process Voice Memo Tool (End-to-End)
5. Update Daily Note with Voice Memo Summary
6. Create Daily Note Template
7. Weekly Review with Obsidian Data

### Success Criteria
- 15-minute transcript → 3-5 memories in < 60 seconds
- Daily note updated with voice memo summary
- Entity relationships visible in graph view
- Weekly review includes Neo4j + Obsidian data

**Timeline**: 3-4 days

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Obsidian MCP Server: YuNaga224/obsidian-memory-mcp

**Why?**
- ✅ Entity-Observation-Relation model (perfect match for Brain OS)
- ✅ No plugins required (works with fresh Obsidian install)
- ✅ File-based (works without Obsidian running)
- ✅ Semantic relationships: `[[Manager of::Alice]]`

### 2. Data Distribution: Neo4j + Obsidian (Complementary)

**Neo4j ONLY** (Computational):
- Salience scoring & decay
- Activation thresholds
- Complex graph queries
- Soft deletion audit trail

**BOTH** (Synchronized):
- Content, entities, observations
- Sector, memory type, source, dates
- Salience (as metadata only)

**Obsidian ONLY** (Human Interface):
- Markdown formatting
- Visual graph view
- Daily notes structure
- Tags, Dataview queries

### 3. Sync Strategy

**Phase 1**: One-way (Neo4j → Obsidian)
**Phase 2**: Bidirectional (cron job every 15 minutes)
**Phase 3**: Enhanced workflows (voice memos, daily notes)

### 4. Conflict Resolution

**Strategy**: Newest timestamp wins
- Compare `last_accessed` (Neo4j) vs `updated` (Obsidian frontmatter)
- If Neo4j newer → skip Obsidian sync
- If Obsidian newer → update Neo4j
- Log conflicts to `logs/obsidian_sync_conflicts.log`

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1 Testing
- Create 10 test memories via Brain OS
- Verify all appear in Obsidian vault
- Check graph view, search, file content
- Test offline mode (Obsidian MCP unavailable)

### Phase 2 Testing
- Edit 5 files in Obsidian
- Wait 15 minutes (or trigger manual sync)
- Verify Neo4j updated correctly
- Bulk export 50 memories, check Obsidian
- Test conflict resolution (edit both Neo4j and Obsidian)

### Phase 3 Testing
- Record 15-minute voice memo
- Run `process_voice_memo(file_path)`
- Verify 3-5 memories created
- Check daily note updated
- Explore graph view relationships
- Run weekly review, verify synthesis

---

## Dependencies

### Software
- **Node.js v18+**: For Obsidian MCP server
- **Obsidian Desktop** (free version): For viewing vault
- **Neo4j**: Already running
- **Brain OS**: Existing setup
- **Note**: Claude handles transcription via MCP (no additional API keys needed)

### Python Packages (New)
- `PyYAML` - Parse Obsidian YAML frontmatter (Phase 2)

### Environment Variables (New)
```env
# Obsidian Integration
OBSIDIAN_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8001/mcp
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=/home/user/brain-os-vault
OBSIDIAN_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15
```

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **YuNaga224 server fails** | High | Fallback: Neo4j continues, queue for retry |
| **Obsidian file corruption** | Medium | Git-based version control recommended |
| **Sync conflicts** | Medium | Timestamp-based resolution + conflict log |
| **Large vaults (500+ entities)** | Medium | Obsidian handles 10k+ notes, should be fine |

---

## Success Metrics (All Phases Complete)

**Technical**:
- ✅ 100+ memories exported to Obsidian
- ✅ Bidirectional sync works (edit Obsidian → Neo4j updates)
- ✅ Voice memo processing < 60 seconds
- ✅ Graph view with 50+ entities + relationships
- ✅ Daily notes auto-updated
- ✅ Zero data loss (Neo4j ↔ Obsidian consistency)

**User Experience**:
- ✅ User creates memory → sees in Obsidian instantly
- ✅ User edits Obsidian → Neo4j syncs in 15 minutes
- ✅ User processes voice memo → 3-5 memories created
- ✅ User explores graph view → understands relationships
- ✅ User runs weekly review → gets comprehensive synthesis
- ✅ User confirms: "This is exactly what I needed"

1. **Approve all 3 phases?** Or request changes?

2. **Phase 1 priority?** Should I start immediately?

3. **Obsidian vault location?** Where should I create `/home/user/brain-os-vault`?

4. **Cron interval?** 15 minutes OK, or prefer different frequency?

- [ ] User approves Phase 1 (or requests changes)
- [ ] User confirms Obsidian vault location
- [ ] User confirms OpenAI API key availability (Phase 3)
- [ ] I proceed with Phase 1 implementation
